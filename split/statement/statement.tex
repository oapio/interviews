\bigskip

We are training a regression on data with one attribute. Write a function, which
finds the best possible split of the data (same thing which decision tree would do in its root).
Try to make the function as efficient as possible.

\bigskip

More specifically:
You are given pairs:
$$(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$$.

For given $s$ we define sets:

$$A_{-} = \{ y_i | x_i < s \}$$
$$A_+ = \{y_i | x_i \geq s\}$$

(those $y_i$ where $x_i < s$ end up $A_-$ and vice versa).


Find $s$, for which $A_i$ and $A_+$ are non empty and value is smallest as possible:
$$\frac{\texttt{Var}(A_-)|A_-| + \texttt{Var}(A_+)|A_+|}{n}$$

($\texttt{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{x \in X} \left (x - \frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{y \in X} y \right )^2$)

\bigskip

You are given inputs and template of the solution in Python (you can also you Java or Scala).
